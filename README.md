# ðŸ¤– ServiceNew Functions ðŸ¤–

This project aims to speed up the time to understand & implement functions with the [beta Slack platform](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart). It uses the beta platform to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) within Slack. 

## Disclaimer
This project is built using pre-released features on the Slack Platform. It may contain bugs, performance issues, and isn't representative of the final product. The code in this project isn't meant to be a standard template. It may change or become legacy as updates are released to the Slack Beta Platform.

# Steps 
1. [Clone the repo](#step-1-clone-the-repo)
2. [ServiceNow Configuration](#step-2-ServiceNow-configuration-basic-auth)
3. [Add Environmental Variables in Hermes](#step-3-add-environmental-variables-in-hermes)
4. [Deploy the App](#step-4-deploy-the-app)
4. [Run the Functions](#step-4-run-the-functions)

## Step 1. Clone the Repo

```git clone git@slack-github.com:hporutiu/ServiceNow-Functions.git```

## Step 2. ServiceNow Configuration Basic Auth

First, we will learn Basic Auth since it is earlier. All we need is username and password. If you want to read how to use 
OAuth 2.0 to get an access token to make your API requests, find the section at the bottom.

* First, gather details from your ServiceNow developer account. First you must get a developer account here: https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do

* Then click on your Profile picture (top right), and select "Manage insance password."

![now_credentials](https://media.slack-github.com/user/2212/files/899f8480-b0d8-11ec-8434-13044b9d4ae8)

* Your SERVICENOW_INSTANCE is `Instance name`
* Your SERVICENOW_USERNAME should just be `admin` unless you or ServiceNow changed something as of March 31, 2022.
* Your SERVICENOW_PW should be there in your login credentials.

> If you want to run this is local mode, you will need to copy the `sample.env` file, rename it to `.env`, add your env variables, and then run `source .env` to set your variables. 

Save all those to a clipboard, since you will need to set them as env variables.

## Step 3. Add Environmental Variables in Hermes
Now, we will need to add our env variables in Hermes. You will do so with the CLI. Make sure you are logged into the CLI first. If you haven't gotten the CLI installed, 
you can find the install script [here](https://api.slack.com/future/quickstart).

```bash
$ hermes-dev var add SERVICENOW_USERNAME [Ctrl+V] [Enter]
$ hermes-dev var add SERVICENOW_PW [Ctrl+V] [Enter]
$ hermes-dev var add SERVICENOW_INSTANCE [Ctrl+V] [Enter]
```

Now that we've added our env variables, we need to tell our Slack Function which domains that we will be sending requests to.
Change this line in your manifest file to use your `SERVICENOW_INSTANCE`.

```
"outgoing_domains": ["dev99588.service-now.com"]
```

## Step 4. Deploy the App

That's it, you're ready to deploy.

```bash
$ hermes-dev deploy
```

## Step 5. Run the Functions

Videos below show how to run the functions.
